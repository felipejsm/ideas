## Show Me Lyrics
### Resume: 
A java program that consumes google's cloud speech recognition api that create a text file containing a song lyric    

### How it would be?
It'll primarily be used to recognize the song, _'extract'_ its lyrics and write it into a file     
It would work like youtube auto subtitle feature    

### How I would like it to be?
Recognize voices and show it like a subtitled movie through the device (browser/mobile/OS*)     

* OS: like [cerebro](https://github.com/KELiON/cerebro)

## Simple Tube / Tune Tube

### Resume: 
A simple page that would access youtube in a radio(AM/FM), style      

### How it would be?
Need to see if it's possible to do a search and extract only the sound through it's API     

### How I would like it to be?
A simple yet elegant website to tune it and play it online. With surge. Simple as that.
