## Show Me Lyrics
### Resume: 
A java program that consumes google's cloud speech recognition api that create a text file containing a song lyric    

### How it would be?
It'll primarily be used to recognize the song, _'extract'_ its lyrics and write it into a file     
It would work like youtube auto subtitle feature    

### How I would like it to be?
Recognize voices and show it like a subtitled movie through the device (browser/mobile/OS*)     

* OS: like [cerebro](https://github.com/KELiON/cerebro)
